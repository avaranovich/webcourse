All slides are created in Markdow and converted into deck.js compatible HTML.
To edit MD files in the web browser, you can use http://prose.io/

## How to get started?
1. Ensure you have Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and Rubygems (http://rubygems.org/) installed.
2. Build keydown gem by executing bootstrap.sh. You should see something like this in the console:
      Successfully built RubyGem
      Name: keydown
      Version: 0.9.4
      File: keydown-0.9.4.gem
