A repository to support the course on web programming http://softlang.wikidot.com/course:webprog

All slides are created in Markdow and converted into deck.js compatible HTML.

## How to get started?
All steps below should be executed only once -- the first time you work with the keydown.
1. Ensure you have Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and Rubygems (http://rubygems.org/) installed.
2. Build keydown gem by executing bootstrap.sh. You should see something like this in the console:
> Successfully built RubyGem   
> Name: keydown   
> Version: 0.9.4   
> File: keydown-0.9.4.gem   
> Successfully installed keydown-0.9.4  
> 1 gem installed  
> Installing ri documentation for keydown-0.9.4...  
> Installing RDoc documentation for keydown-0.9.4...  
3. Ensure you have gem executable folder in your PATH. How to know what is your gem executable folder? Run gem env and look at the value of EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY
